/**
 * Purpose: The AnimationHandler class' purpose is what the title says, it handles the animation of
 * the TurtleView/ImageView object. Contains methods that are used to create the animation based off
 * changes in the passed TurtleRecord object.
 * <p>
 * Assumptions: I assume that this is correctly created and set up in the slogoGUI class; Moreover,
 * I assume that it's correctly notified by the Controller class and slogoGUI class on when to
 * create animations for a new command.
 * <p>
 * Dependencies: Depends on the main slogoGUI class where it's created, partially on the Controller
 * class which notifies it, and multiple JavaFX scene imports in order to create the animation
 * <p>
 * Example: When there's a list of animations, the Controller class notifies the slogoGUI class
 * through the API, which then calls this AnimationHandler methods that create the different
 * animations for each command. Once all the commands are run through, plays through the entire
 * animation.
