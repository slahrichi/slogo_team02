/**
 * Purpose: The purpose of this class is that it handles the writing of .slogo files by retrieving
 * the editor contents and saving it as a .slogo file
 * <p>
 * Assumption: We assume that the string being passed to the SlogoWriter is the correct string of
 * the program that the user wants to save. It doesn't check if the String is correct or not.
 * <p>
 * Dependencies: This class depends on multiple file imports as well as javaFx stage effects in
 * order to create a window for user input. It then has some event handlers to check when the submit
 * input button is pressed.
 * <p>
 * Example: When the save button is pressed, the users inserts a title and clicks submit file to
 * create the file. This file is then saved in the data folder under saves.

 * Misc: N/A
